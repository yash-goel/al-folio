  title={PIVO: Probabilistic Inverse Velocity Obstacle for Navigation under Uncertainty},
  author={PS Naga Jyotish and Yash Goel and AVS Sai Bhargav Kumar and K Madhava Krishna},
  abstract={In this paper, we present an algorithmic framework which computes the collision-free velocities for the robot in a human shared dynamic and uncertain environment. We extend the concept of Inverse Velocity Obstacle (IVO) to a probabilistic variant to handle the state estimation and motion uncertainties that arise due to the other participants of the environment. These uncertainties are modeled as non-parametric probability distributions. In our PIVO: Probabilistic Inverse Velocity Obstacle, we propose the collision-free navigation as an optimization problem by reformulating the velocity conditions of IVO as chance constraints that takes the uncertainty into account. The space of collision-free velocities that result from the presented optimization scheme are associated to a confidence measure as a specified probability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PIVO through numerical simulations and demonstrating its ability to generate safe trajectories under highly uncertain environments.},

  title={IVO: Inverse Velocity Obstacles for Real Time Navigation},
  author={PS Naga Jyotish and Yash Goel and AVS Sai Bhargav Kumar and K Madhava Krishna},
  abstract={In this paper, we present IVO: Inverse Velocity Obstacles an egocentric framework that improves the real time implementation. The proposed method stems from the concept of velocity obstacle and can be applied for both single agent and multi-agent system. It focuses on computing collision free maneuvers without any knowledge or assumption on the pose and the velocity of the robot. This is primarily achieved by reformulating the velocity obstacle to adapt to an ego-centric framework. This is a significant step towards improving real time implementations of collision avoidance in dynamic environments as there is no dependency on state estimation techniques to infer the robot pose and velocity. We evaluate IVO for both single agent and multi-agent in different scenarios and show it's efficacy over the existing formulations. We also show the real time scalability of the proposed methodology.},
