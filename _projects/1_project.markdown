I was actively involved in the design and fabrication of our self designed formula style electric race car for the Formula SAE competition. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlYoQ3vBIN4&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=YashGoel) our car in full action.

In particular, I was responsible for design, FEA and fabrication of drivetrain parts of 2017 car SABER as the Powertrain Head of the team. This also required me to lead the powertrain team working on present and future designs of the car.

I also introduced the  `vehicle dynamics`  unit in the team wherein I designed the vehicle dynamics model, active yaw slip controller and system for torque distribution.
This required designing a high fidelity model in Simulink with controller design exploring different strategies like PID.
