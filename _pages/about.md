I am a masters student at the `University of Bonn` studying Geodetic Engineering majoring in `Mobile Sensing and Robotics`. I am currently working as a student assistant at [`StachnissLab`](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/) working on incremental mapping and surface reconstruction methods.

I am interested in robotics at the intersection of `control`, `navigation`, `mapping` and autonomy in general. I have worked in a wide variety of areas ranging from robotics to designing formula style electric racecar for `Formula SAE` and hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. I did my undergraduation in mechanical engineering from `IIT Roorkee`. After which, I worked on dynamic obstacle avoidance under uncertainty at `Robotics Research Centre, IIIT Hyderabad`.
